# How to run
-To run the proposed method run ‘run3_o3.py’.
-When you run the method on a dataset, it saves the results in a folder called ‘Results’. Note that if you have already run the method on a dataset and have the results in the ‘results’ folder, you cannot run it again on the same data until you delete the results in the ‘Results’ folder.
- To Run the base dmethod you need to run 'run3_o1.py'

# Requirment
The code was run in an environment in Anaconda. A list of the installed packages in the environment where the code was run is available in requirements.txt
